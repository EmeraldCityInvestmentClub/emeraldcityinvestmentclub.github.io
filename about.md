Emerald City Investment Club (ECIC) was formed 30 years ago for individuals who prefer to manage their own portfolio. Our members conduct monthly stock presentations on new stocks, annual reviews of the stocks held in the ECIC portfolio, as well as round-table discussions about the overall market.

This is a great educational resource for someone new to investing to receive help and guidance towards lifelong savings and investing goals. We have been a small club with about 7â€“14 members, mostly from the Central and North Seattle areas. We meet every second Tuesday of the month and only require a minimal monthly investment into the jointly-held club portfolio.

So go ahead and [contact us](/contact/), we will be looking forward to hearing from you and discussing your investing goals.

President ECIC
